### > ❗  / Blue16 will become my main project now.
## > Why?
- I guess you remember, Blue16 was popular and good revival, but because of incident with ariez, revival fell off and became worst. Even tho ariez helped me with it, after removing staff from him, he came back and nuked the server, Blue16 dissapeared, gone, like he wasnt existed ever. Forgotten for a long time.
- Now its my time to make Blue16 alive again. Me, with my friend *max*, are about to revive Blue16, new, best and most important: customizable.
